        <h1>Full Service Interior Design</h1>
        <p>
          For the homeowner who values a true turn-key experience from start to
          finish. Whether building a new home, exploring an extensive
          renovation, or desiring a decorative transformation, we follow the
          same process to deliver a comprehensive result with functionality and
          beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with an extensive interview, then create design concepts and
          renderings to review and have further discussions. Once a direction is
          confirmed, we set a process in place for New Construction, Remodeling,
          and/or Full Service Furnishings.
        </p>
        <p>Home Furnishings & Decor</p>
        <p>
          We blend the old with the new to accomplish a carefully curated design
          that suits your aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          We source directly from our US trade partners and offer custom,
          semi-custom, ready-made furnishings and home decor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We create made-to-order bedding and custom draperies with a dedication
          to original design, luxurious materials, and the skilled artistry of
          the seamstresses in our local workroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We coordinate with local artisans and the trades to prepare your space
          with new color, patterns, and finishes.
        </p>
        <p>and finally,</p>
        <p>
          We manage the procurement process from ordering to installation, and
          give you a beautiful reveal day to take it all in.

        <h1>New Construction and Large Scale Remodeling Clients</h1>
        <p>
          Building a home requires myriad decisions to be made in a timely
          fashion. We bring the joy, alleviate the stress, and keep you
          organized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, we partner with you during the planning stages with your
          architect. Once plans are finalized, we'll guide you through the
          entire selection process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide a detailed selections & specifications binder to you and
          your builder that becomes an integral part of the construction
          documents that bring your home to life, and we partner with you
          through the entire construction process.
        </p>
        <p>
          In parallel, we can also assist in space planning and furniture
          selections to seamlessly blend your existing furnishings and decor
          with new items needed in a timeline that coordinates with your move in
          date.

        <p>
          If you are a luxury homebuilder in central Georgia, we invite
          collaboration in two distinct ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          One option includes whole-home selections based on your finished
          plans, specifications, and allowances, complete with marketing
          materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second option, we partner with you and your client, allowing
          your time to be spent solely on construction while we navigate the
          selections process with your clients and vendor partners.
